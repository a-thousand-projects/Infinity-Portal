# Introduction 
The Infinity Portal is a toy allowing different light patters to be contained within an Infinity portal. The initial idea is to release a basic kit with 5 light patters including sound to light. 

Further advances will see this you become an educational programming tpy, allowing users to create their own patters and reaction in code or code blocks and upload them to the device.
